# sit-on-chair-warsztat
First website made using html/css/js sit-on-chair.

The point of this project was to build working website using elementary tools that I learned during my first weeks on bootcamp.
Used "index = ( list.length * (index + 1) + (index - 1) ) % list.length;" for handling slides as an interesting way of handling decreasing index in slider. When it hits 0 it goes back to highest index.

The site is in Polish language.
